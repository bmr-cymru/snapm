# Snapm

Snapshot manager (snapm) is a tool for managing sets of snapshots on Linux
systems.  The snapm tool allows snapshots of multiple volumes to be captured at
the same time, representing the system state at the time the set was created.

The tool has a modular plugin architecture allowing different snapshot backends
to be used together. Currently snapshots using LVM2 copy-on-write and thinly
provisioned snapshots are supported.

Snapm aims to be a simple and extensible, and to be able to create snapshots for
a wide range of Linux system configurations.

## Reporting bugs

Please report bugs by opening an issue in the [GitHub Issue Tracker][1]

## Building and installing Snapm

A `setuptools` based build script is provided: local installations and
package builds can be performed by running `python setup.py` and a
setup command. See `python setup.py --help` for detailed information on
the available options and commands.

### Building an RPM package
A spec file is included in the repository that can be used to build RPM packages
of snapm. The packit service is also enabled for new pull requests and will
automatically build packages for fedora-stable and fedora-development.

## The snapm command

The `snapm` command is the main interface to the snapshot manager.  It is able
to create, delete, and display snapshots and snapshot sets and provides reports
listing the snapshots and snapshot sets available on the system.

Snapm commands normally operate on a particular object type: a snapshot set or an
individual snapshot.

```
# snapm snapset <command> <options> # `snapset` command
```

```
# snapm snapshot <command> <options> # `snapshot` command
```

### Snapshot sets

Snapshot manager groups snapshots taken at the same moment in time into a named
"snapshot set", or snapset. This allows the snapshots to be managed as a single
unit and simplifies the management of snapshots of multiple volumes. Each
snapshot set must contain at least one snapshot.

### Snapm subcommands
#### snapset
The `snapset` subcommand is used to create, delete, rename, activate,
deactivate, list and display snapsets.

##### create
Create a new snapset with the provided name and list of mount points.
```
# snapm snapset create [-b|--bootable] [-r|--revert] <name> mount_point...
```
###### Size Policies
Size policies can be used to control the size of fixed-sized snapshots and to
check for available space when creating a snapshot set.

Some snapshot implementations (Lvm2CoW) require a fixed size to be specified
for the snapshot backstore when the snapshot is created. The default size
allocated by snapshot manager is 2x the current file system usage, allowing the
existing content of the volume to be overwritten twice before exhausting the
snapshot space.

Plugins for snapshot providers that do not require a fixed snapshot size will
check that space is available for the requested size policy at snapshot set
creation time.

Size policy hints can be manually given on the command line to override the
default behavior on a per-mount point basis. Four policies are available:

 * FIXED - a fixed size given on the command line
 * FREE - a percentage fraction of the free space available
 * USED - a percentage fraction of the space currently used on the mount point
   (may be greater than 100%)
 * SIZE - a percentage fraction of the origin device size from 0 to 100%

The FIXED size policy accepts optional units of KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB
and ZiB. Units may be abbreviated to the first character.

Per-mount point size policies are specified by adding a ':' and the required
policy to the corresponding mount point path, for example:


```
# snapm snapset create backup /:2G /var:1G /home
```

```
# snapm snapset create backup /:25%FREE /var:25%FREE /home
```

```
# snapm snapset create backup /:100%USED /var:100%USED /home
```

```
# snapm snapset create backup /:100%SIZE /var:100%SIZE /home
```

If no size policy is specified the default `200%USED` is applied. To ensure a
volume can be completely overwritten specify `100%SIZE`. This requires more
storage capacity but avoids the snapshot running out of space.

##### delete
Delete an existing snapset by name or uuid.
```
# snapm snapset delete <name|uuid>
```

##### rename
Rename an existing snapset.
```
# snapm snapset rename <old_name> <new_name>
```

##### revert
Revert an existing snapset, re-setting the content of the origin volumes
to the state they were in at the time the snapset was created. The snapset
to be reverted may be specified either by its name or uuid.

Rolling back a snapshot set with mounted and in-use origin volumes will
schedule the revert to take place the next time that the volumes are
activated, for example by booting into a configured revert boot entry for
the snapshot set.
```
# snapm snapset revert <name|uuid>
```

##### activate
Activate the members of an existing snapset, or all snapsets if no name or
uuid argument is given.
```
# snapm snapset activate [<name|uuid>]
```

##### deactivate
Deactivate the members of an existing snapset, or all snapsets if no name or
uuid argument is given.
```
# snapm snapset deactivate [<name|uuid>]
```

##### autoactivate
Enable or disable autoactivation for the snapshots in a snapshot set.
```
# snapm snapset autoactivate [--yes|--no] [<name|uuid>]
```

##### list
List available snapsets matching selection criteria.
```
# snapm snapset list [<name|uuid>]
```

##### show
Display available snapsets matching selection criteria.
```
# snapm snapset show [<name|uuid>]
```

#### snapshot
The `snapshot` command is used to manipulate, list, and display snapshots.

##### snapshot activate
Activate individual snapshots matching selection criteria.
```
# snapm snapshot activate [-N name] [-U uuid] [<name|uuid>]
```

##### snapshot deactivate
Deactivate individual snapshots matching selection criteria.
```
# snapm snapshot deactivate [-N name] [-U uuid] [<name|uuid>]
```

##### snapshot autoactivate
Enable or disable autoactivation for individual snapshots matching selection
criteria.
```
# snapm snapshot autoactivate [--yes|--no] [-N name] [-U uuid] [<name|uuid>]
```

##### snapshot list
List available snapshots matching selection criteria.
```
# snapm snapshot list [<name|uuid>]
```

##### snapshot show
Display available snapshots matching selection criteria.
```
# snapm snapshot show [<name|uuid>]
```

### Reporting commands

The `snapm snapset list` and `snapm snapshot list` commands generate
a tabular report as output. To control the list of displayed fields
use the `-o/--options FIELDS` argument:

```
# snapm snapset list -oname,mountpoints
SnapsetName  MountPoints
backup       /, /home, /var
userdata     /data, /home
```

To add extra fields to the default selection, prefix the field list
with the `+` character:

```
# snapm snapset list -o+uuid
SnapsetName  Time                 NrSnapshots Status  MountPoints              SnapsetUuid
backup       2023-11-21 16:01:31            3 Active  /, /home, /var           fb76b84b-b615-5aa7-8b2c-713614794a12
userdata     2023-11-21 15:58:08            2 Active  /data, /home             6eb17db2-c95d-5fb0-8daa-5934d7c9c2d4
```

To display the available fields for either report use the field
name `help`.
